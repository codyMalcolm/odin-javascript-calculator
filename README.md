# Javascript Calculator

## Objective

To build a calculator using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

#### Specifications

##### Main

1. The calculator should contain all of the basic mathematical functions (`+`, `-`, `*`, and `-`).
2. There are some specific requirements for how the program should be structured.
* The operations should be handled in separate functions and returned to the `operate()` function.
* The `operate()` function takes two numbers and an operator.
3. The calculator should have buttons for each operator, each of the numbers, equals, and clear.
4. The calculator should have a display.
5. The display should update with the solution to the operation once `=` is pressed.
6. Multiple consecutive operations should be possible (eg. `12 + 7 - 5 * 3` and should give the correct answer).
7. Answers with long decimals (eg. `3.3333333333333`) should be rounded.
8. A "snarky" error message should be displayed if the user tries to divide by zero.

##### Recommended

1. Make it look pretty.

##### Optional

1. Add a decimal button.
2. Add a backspace button.
3. Add keyboard support.

##### Ambiguous

1. Should the calculator observe order of operations or apply operations in the order entered?
2. What should happen if the user presses `=`, returing a result, and then immediately presses:
 * an operator?
 * a number?
3. How many decimals should we round long numbers to?

##### Personal Extras

1. Add support for parenthesis.
2. Add support for exponents and roots.

#### Learning Objectives

To gain experience with Javascript, logic, and interaction and manipulation with the DOM.

## Author's Notes

#### Preliminary Thoughts

I've already built a [Javascript calculator](https://codepen.io/CTKShadow/pen/LBeGjL), so I'm going to add as much as possible to challenge myself, including parsing the data in a different way (as I wasn't completely satisfied with the solution in that other calculator). As such, this calculator will observe order of operations. As for ambiguity \#2, the calculator will operate on a result if an operator is pressed first, and will clear the input if a number or decimal is pressed first. I will round repeating numbers to 10 decimal places.

#### Final Thoughts

To be filled out upon project completion.
